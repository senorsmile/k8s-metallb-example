# metallb + kuard example

This repo contains manifests to create a local metallb LoadBalancer "supplier", using the kuard sample deployment from "Kubernetes Up and Running".

It was tested with senorsmile's fork of kubespray, running on vagrant: 
https://github.com/senorsmile/kubespray

Adjust the IP addresses to test on a different subnet.
